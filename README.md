The PetAdoptionAPI is focused on raising awareness for street dogs, primarily from Serbia, who are still living on the streets. These real street dogs, whose images were provided by a friend, face harsh conditions daily.

This project aims to highlight their situation and inspire action, whether through supporting animal shelters, spreading awareness, or fostering a rescue mentality. It is not about adoption but about giving these animals a voice and encouraging change.
